    <h2>The Influence of the Caesar Cipher</h2>

While my knowledge of the Caesar Cipher encryption method is quite high by my standards thanks to its easy learning curve, it is not mistaken as to how much its impact has been felt in the world of cybersecurity. The Caesar cipher is one of the world's first encryption techniques despite its age and ease of use, in historical terms, this technique was seen as revolutionary to the ones who first practiced it, including in the time of the Roman Republic.
<br>
How significant was the Caesar Cipher in modern cryptography? Despite its ease of use, it is incredibly easy to crack as well. Just guessing the shift of the letters is enough for a Caesar Cipher to be cracked, and as a result, I do not consider the cipher to be a very secure method to protect messages against potential attackers who may guess the message just by shifting letters around. However, there are more modern methods of encryption that do a better job than the Caesar Cipher at protecting information, such as SHA-256 and MD6. Most of modern cryptography owes itself to the groundbreaking method that Julius Caesar popularized, while it was not as popular before or after his time, its influence cannot be underestimated.
<br>
The most popular shift method that the Caesar Cipher is known for is Shift+3, or shifting forward 3 letters or numbers. Basically, for each letter, the 3rd letter after is the one the former is replaced by, so A becomes D, and L becomes O, etc. Multiple shift methods have been used, like shift backwards or shift forwards by larger than 3 digits. There is even a stronger variation of the Cipher that diverges based on the odd and even placement of letters and numbers, and whether they shift forward or backward based on their ordering. For example, every odd letter shifts forward the the next odd letter, and each even letter shifts to the previous even letter.
<br>
I cannot make my case more clear about why the Caesar Cipher is so influenctial to modern cryptography, as it was one of the first widespread usage of encryption and decryption in recorded history, and spearheaded later development of other cryptographic methods. As such, it is considered in my view, the most influential of such methods in the history of this field.
