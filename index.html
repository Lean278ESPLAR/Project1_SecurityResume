        <h2 class="section-title">Lean's Methodology of Cyber Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes, the best way of learning is by encountering it yourself. 
            <br><br>
            As the need for protecting our devices becomes even more of a necessity by the day, it is important for users to
            know simple terms to concepts cybersecurity experts have on the go. The focus is not to burden users with needless
            information that can be used sparingly, but rather to describe more simply for them to remember.
            <br>
            My name is Lean Campana, a cybersecurity enthusiast and a former software language developer. I care about security
            because the cyber world is filled with many unknowns that many a citizen usually do not delve into. Here, you can
            find things that can be extremely useful as concepts, whether be learned or from personal experience. Have a look!

                <h4>Antivirus</h4>
                <p>Many of us use more than just the operating system's built-in antivirus software - but is it really necessary?
                   Even more so, do we need to use more than 1 antivirus software at all? <br>

                <h4>Cryptography</h4>
                <p>
                    The Caesar Cipher was one of the world's first cryptographical encryption methods. And despite its easy difficulty
                    to crack, its influence on modern cryptography remains far and above.
