       <h2>Is it Necessary to Use Additional Antivirus Software?</h2>
       <p>
       <b>Category: Antivirus</b>
       <br>
       As a user of Norton's antivirus software for well over a decade and a half, I have tangled with the dilemma that was the usage of both the built-in Windows Defender that came with the respective operating system, and the Antivirus software my dad frequently uses, which was Norton Antivirus. Windows Defender used to be optional but was built-in later on. I have so far not experienced any major security incidents related to the major vulnerabilities of the day, such as trojans, malware, worms, and ransomware, although only minor compromises occurred as far as I remember. They occurred such a long time ago that I don't think I remember any details concerning these breaches in security.
<br>
This leads me to a question I find myself asking: would it be necessary to use additional antivirus software to enhance the operating system's security? This does not mean using built-in antivirus software and another 3rd party software at the same time, and there are several big reasons why using more than one antivirus software is a bad idea in itself. Running two antiviruses does a number on the computer's resources, especially the disk usage, which relies on the speed of inputs and outputs, or I/O reads. Many older computers, including my Windows 10 from 2017, have built-in disk hard drives that are slower than solid state drives, and thus running two anti-viruses at once will cause often severe slowdowns to the computer, preventing them from doing normal tasks at full speed. Even running one antivirus software could still cause some issues, especially when scanning the entire system, or when software updates are running in the background somewhere. In many cases, especially recently, I kept an eye out for the disk usage of my Norton Antivirus software concerning my primary disk drive, and in some cases, its disk usage was 100%. Considering the software runs while I am gaming on my PC, this causes the processes to slow down to a crawl sometimes.
<br>
As a result, I just ran one antivirus software in the background, which is Norton Antivirus, and disabled Windows Defender. I have not used Windows Defender in over 5 years until I recently got another computer. I opted not to use Norton Antivirus on this particular computer, although it is not primarily for gaming. After around 2 months of using Windows Defender, I can report some of the following findings that stood out to me in my personal experience. The first finding was that Windows Defender and Norton Antivirus do largely the same things, except for additional functions, such as file cleaning and optimization. The latter two functions have built-in equivalents, meaning that the usage of the Norton Antivirus for these functions is largely optional. The second finding was that Windows Defender in my experience does not use much disk space except when it is doing certain scanning functions, although I have not run a full system scan in my Defender-only system. This is something that Norton Antivirus does as well. Finally, as long as they are kept up to date, there is not much need to worry about in terms of attack susceptibility, on both ends.
<br>
So, in my conclusion: Is it necessary to use additional antivirus software? My answer would be no. But if one feels like getting additional antivirus software for whatever reason, just disable the built-in antivirus software so that they do not conflict. Just use one, or the other.
